Hi there! I'm Marysia, 25, live in Amsterdam. 

I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and currently work as a data scientist for [Aidence](http://www.aidence.com), where we use deep learning to analyse medical images. Applying machine learning to healthcare is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most interesting applications of AI with the most tangible real-world benefits (though  sustainability and accessible personalised education may be equally compelling). I'm also part of the organisation of the [PyData Amsterdam](http://pydata.org/amsterdam2019/) conference.

Other things on my ever expanding list of interests (which I may write about on the [blog](/blog/) at some point in the future) are in no particular order: learning analytics, logic, fair division and resource allocation, voting systems, natural language processing, multi-agent systems, neuroscience, language philosophy, education, and knowledge sharing in general. I'm particularly passionate about programming education, as I love to share my enthousiasm for programming and tech with others, especially girls.

On the side, I'm a boardgame enthousiast, very happy owner of every single Pokémon game ever brought out by Nintendo (yes, including Pokémon Snap), enjoy storytelling, a strong appreciator of coffee (both quality and quantity), love experiencing and learning new things (case in point: recently followed this [slacklining course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDlFf4WDBTk)), and occasionally like to dabble in concert photography. 

Don't hesitate to shoot me a message at [hello@marysia.nl](mailto:hello@marysia.nl).

I'll leave you with a picture of this little guy, a Swiss White Shepherd called _Ender_ (after Ender Wiggin).
