Hi there! I'm Marysia, 25, live in Amsterdam. 

I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and currently work as a machine learning engineer for [Aidence](http://www.aidence.com), where we use deep learning to analyse medical images. Applying machine learning to healthcare is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most interesting applications of AI with the most tangible real-world benefits. 

Besides that, I'm co-chair of the [PyData Amsterdam](http://pydata.org/amsterdam2019/) conference, the educational program of NUMfocus (the non-profit behind open source Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Jupyter and matplotlib). I greatly enjoy meeting other people from the data science community and often  attend meet ups in and around Amsterdam. 


Although I work in medical image analysis, during my studies I particularly enjoyed working on projects related to learning analytics, logic, fair division and resource allocation, voting systems and invariance/equivariance in convolutional neural networks. I also still eagerly read anything about  natural language processing, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, neuroscience, language philosophy and education. I'm particularly passionate about programming education, as I love to share my enthousiasm for programming and tech with others, especially girls. 


On the side, I'm a boardgame enthousiast, very happy owner of every single Pokémon game ever released (currently playing _Let's Go! Eevee_), enjoy storytelling evenings at Mezrab, have the [cutest dog ever](../assets/ender.jpg), am a strong appreciator of coffee (both quality and quantity), love learning new active things (like [slacklining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDlFf4WDBTk)), and occasionally like to dabble in concert photography. 

Don't hesitate to shoot me a message at [hello@marysia.nl](mailto:hello@marysia.nl).
