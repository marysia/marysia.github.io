Hi there! I'm Marysia. Machine learning R&D engineer. Co-chair PyData Amsterdam. Advocate for accessible programming education for girls.

I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and currently work as a machine learning engineer for [Aidence](http://www.aidence.com), where we use deep learning for medical image analysis. Applying machine learning to healthcare is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most interesting applications of AI with the most tangible real-world benefits. 

I am also co-chair of [PyData Amsterdam](http://amsterdam.pydata.org), for which we organise a yearly conference and regular meetups. I greatly enjoy meeting other people from the data science community and you can often find me at meet ups in and around Amsterdam. I'm also particularly passionate about programming education, and love to share my enthousiasm for programming and tech with others, especially young girls. 

<!---
Although I work in medical image analysis, during my studies I particularly enjoyed working on projects related to learning analytics, logic, fair division and resource allocation, voting systems and invariance/equivariance in convolutional neural networks. I also still eagerly read anything about  natural language processing, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, neuroscience, language philosophy and education. I'm particularly passionate about programming education, as I love to share my enthousiasm for programming and tech with others, especially girls.

On the side, I'm a boardgame enthousiast, proud owner of nearly all Pok√©mon games (currently playing _Let's Go! Eevee_), enjoy storytelling evenings at Mezrab, have an [adorable dog](../assets/ender.jpg), am a strong appreciator of coffee (both quality and quantity), love learning new things (like [slacklining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDlFf4WDBTk){:.no-lightbox}), and occasionally like to dabble in [concert photography](https://marysia.nl/photos/). 

Don't hesitate to shoot me a message at [hello@marysia.nl](mailto:hello@marysia.nl).
