Hi there! I'm Marysia, 25, live in Amsterdam. 

I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and currently work as a machine learning engineer for [Aidence](http://www.aidence.com), where we use deep learning to analyse medical images. Applying machine learning to healthcare is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most interesting applications of AI with the most tangible real-world benefits, though sustainability and accessible personalised education are similarly compelling to me.

Other things on my ever expanding list of interests are in no particular order: learning analytics, logic, fair division and resource allocation, voting systems, natural language processing, multi-agent systems, neuroscience, language philosophy, education, and knowledge sharing in general. I'm particularly passionate about programming education, as I love to share my enthousiasm for programming and tech with others, especially girls.  I'm also part of the organisation of the [PyData Amsterdam](http://pydata.org/amsterdam2019/) conference.

On the side, I'm a boardgame enthousiast, very happy owner of every single Pokémon game ever released by Nintendo (yes, including Pokémon Snap), enjoy storytelling, a strong appreciator of coffee (both quality and quantity), love experiencing and learning new things (case in point: recently followed this [slacklining course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDlFf4WDBTk)), and occasionally like to dabble in concert photography. 

Don't hesitate to shoot me a message at [hello@marysia.nl](mailto:hello@marysia.nl).
