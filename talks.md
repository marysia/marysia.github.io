<!--#### PyData Festival 2020 (co-chair)
A week-long online festival to serve as an alternative to the IRL conference. Each day had a dedicated theme (Engineering, Fairness & Data, Open Source, Python, Applications) and sessions during breakfast (tutorials/workshops), lunch (panels, interviews, sprint preparation sessions) and after dinner (talks).

 Highlights include: interviews with the creator of Python (Guido van Rossum), core developer of Scikit Learn (Adrin Jalali), release managers of Python 3.8/3.9 (Łukasz Langa) and Python 3.10/3.11 (Pablo Galindo Salgado) and a Pandas sprint lead by a Pandas maintainer (Marco Gorelli).
