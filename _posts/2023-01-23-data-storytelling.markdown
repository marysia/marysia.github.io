Data visualization is a common tool in a data scientist's toolbox to explore data. A matplotlib scatter plot here, a seaborn boxplot there -- visualizations help us the uncover secrets in our data. 

<div class="Figure">

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/storytelling/exploratory.png" alt="Image" height="200"/>
</div>

However, in addition to exploring our data, we also often find ourselves in a position where we want to *communicate* about our data. Maybe you found that the customer satisfaction is going down over time, or perhaps there is an unexpected increase in sales of a particular product? 

These are insights you won't want to keep to yourself, but share with others who might benefit from this information. But how would you go about this? Would you present your audience with the raw data, rows and rows of numbers and values?

<div class="Figure">
	<br>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/storytelling/table.png" alt="Image" height="150"/>
</div>


Probably not. Even though the information is all there in the data, the format in which you're presenting it -- a table -- is difficult to distill. That's why you utilised some form of data visualization in the first place!

Yes, you could elaborate on the data table shown in the presentation, and guide your audience towards the insight you want them to know about, but presenting the raw data doesn't add much value. It doesn't convince your audience; they still get the most important information -- that is, what is *important* about what you're showing them -- from listening to you, not the slide. 

That's why we typically show a visualization instead. It shows data to back up your argument, but in a more presentable format.

<div class="Figure">
	<br>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/storytelling/insight.png" alt="Image" height="150"/>
</div>

#### > *This is where things go wrong.*


We tend to use the visualization that we used for *exploratory* data analysis, as our *explanatory* visualization in our presentation. But this exploratory visualization suffers from the same problem the raw data table did. 

When you explore your data, you have the luxury of time. You can look at summary statistics, create different visualizations, spend time disecting the information on the graph presented to you, and make connections to insights you gathered before. 

But please don't expect your audience to do all that work, *again*. Help them out by directing their focus towards the interesting part. Some simple adjustments to your graph can help guide your audience's attention towards the part of the data you want to talk about.
 
<!-- Rather than explaining your visualization, and talking them through what the most important aspects of the data are -- show them! -->

So instead of this... 

<div class="Figure">
	<br>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/storytelling/lang-bad.png" alt="Image" width="300"/>
</div>

... make it easy for them, and show them this: 

<div class="Figure">
	<br>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/storytelling/lang-good-1.png" alt="Image" width="300"/>
</div>


Now you and your audience have time to talk about what the next best action is to take, based on this insight, as  you did not have to waste any time explaining why you showed them this graph. â˜º


### Takeaway
#### *A great exploratory data visualization provides **you** with a lot of insight into your data. A great explanatory visualization draws the focus of **the audience** to what they need to know.* 

<!-- You can even take this one step further. By adding more context, and an (opinionated) associated action, you can guide the audience towards the conclusion you want them to draw -- and the action you want them to take.
