Hi there! I'm Marysia. This is a space where I write about things. 

I am currently: 
* Member of Technical Staff  @ [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)
* Chair @ [PyData Amsterdam](http://amsterdam.pydata.org) 
* Science Communication Volunteer @ [510](https://510.global) \| An initiative by the Netherlands Red Cross.

Previously, I've been chair of [PyData Global 2021](https://pydata.org/global2021/), spoken at [various conferences](https://marysia.nl/talks/), competed in [competitions](https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/data-centric-ai-competition-godatadriven/), taught over a 1000 hours of data science & python trainings through [Xebia Data](www.xebia.com), and dabbled in bit in [geometric deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04656).
 
Nowadays, I'm most interested in [data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgtdPwUrP5I), data quality of post-training data, sharing knowledge and and supporting the open source Python ecosystem.
